        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p class="description">
            BitePair is a web-based food and drink ordering application that enhances the dining experience by using artificial intelligence to recommend a food and drink pairing to enhance your dining experience, and addresses ways to ensure the safety of customers with food allergies. When a user orders food, BitePair will suggest a complementary drink pairing and vice versa, using OpenAI. As for the food allergies, clear allergy labels are listed on every food and drink item to show a clear indication when the ingredients are listed. More information on the allergen is shown when interacting with the labels, in addition to showing what products have similar allergens to help bring awareness, as this would make making food and drink choices easier and safer.
